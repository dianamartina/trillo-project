### Course : Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! by Jonas Schmedtmann

The project is a UI fictional booking app.

The website is beautifully animated with a modern look, fully responsive. 

It uses only HTML and Sass(CSS) with SCSS syntax, no CSS framework added, and Flexbox for alignment.

The CSS architecture structure uses BEM.

The project uses many modern CSS techniques to create stunning designs and effects like: modern hover, pulsate animation, mask-image, reusable custom buttons with push effect.
